dashbo
======

`dashbo` displays graphs from your graphite server.
It is a simple dashboard system baked by `node.js` and `redis`.

At the moment, adding and removing graphs is done by communicating with redis directly over `redis-cli`.

Installation
============

```bash
# install node.js
# install redis
# clone git repository
npm install
node app.js
```
